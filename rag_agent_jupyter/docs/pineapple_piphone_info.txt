Pineapple Technologies is a fictional tech giant based in Redwood Valley, California.
Founded in 1982 by Lana Swift, Igor Dusk, and Martina Vale, the company rose to fame with its Pi-Phone series.
Milestones include the invention of the NeuralPalm interface (1995), the PineTab (2004), and the launch of the PiOS quantum chip (2022).
CEO Aurora Finch took the helm in 2018, guiding the company through a major holographic transition.
Pineapple is renowned for its bold experiments in augmented reality and biometric AI.



The Pi-Phone debuted in 2009, introducing the world to the first shape-shifting display.
Each Pi-Phone iteration has included fantastical features like Emotion Recognition OS (2012), pocket nuclear recharging (2016), and Telepathy Sync (2025).
Annual Pi-Phone sales peaked at 500 million units in 2023, driven by holographic gaming capabilities.
Major manufacturing is handled by partners like RoboCore and SynthMaker Inc., located in geosynchronous orbit facilities.
The Pi-Phone represents over 60% of Pineapple's revenue, with rumors of a sentient model on the horizon.
